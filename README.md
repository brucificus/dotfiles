# Dotfiles

After cloning this repo, run `install` to automatically set up the development
environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run
multiple times.

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot][dotbot] for installation.

This is cross-machine shared content. Machine-specific configuration, is located in branches of `dotfiles-local`.

Making Local Customizations
---------------------------

You can make local customizations for some programs by editing these files:

* `zsh` / `bash` : `~/.shell_local_before` run first
* `zsh` : `~/.zshrc_local_before` run before `.zshrc`
* `zsh` : `~/.zshrc_local_after` run after `.zshrc`
* `zsh` / `bash` : `~/.shell_local_after` run last
